Create an abstract class Vehicle with two abstract methods SeatBooking and Accelerate. Create three more classes(car, bus, train/plane), inherit them and override these two methods in those three classes. Then create references and objects and use those methods, as we usually do in abstraction. You also have to use the keyword final for a class, method and a variable, either in the same program or in a different program.
