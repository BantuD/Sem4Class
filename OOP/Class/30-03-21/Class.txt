Started Multithreading. (JavaC 233)
*thread can be implemented or can be created using thread Class
 Or there is a interface Runnable

*Thread.currentThread(); -> returns you the object of the current thread.

* if you using sleep(int) by the use of class name it will simply sleep that thread in which you using it.

* getPriority() is the function which you can call through the reference or through the class name 
  this funtion will return you the current priority of the thread.

* In java 60 to 70% of the questions will come from Threads.

* As it is always better to implement Runnable rather than extending Thread Class. (At time 36 mins)

* Run() method -> Thread life cycle's execution phase depends on run() method.

* We start the Thread using start() method with the object of MyThread Class 
  What start will do is it will start the run() method inside the MyThread Class.
