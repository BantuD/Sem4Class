//Marker interface makes the class clonable

	Interface does not have constructor
	Data  member in interface are automatically final so you have to declare when you initialize then.
	Whatever datamaber you are defining interface by default declares it as final (Naming rule) you declare datamamber in capital letters
	also data members are static.
	As you can say they are declared as static final <data type> variable_name
	And methods are by default pbulic abstract <data type> fun_name()
